# Summer Code Jam 2021

### For our Code Jam project, we decided to make a retro style console, with 3 games, that could be opened.
* Games:
    * Pong
    * Snake
    * Mine

## How To Run:
 1) Install all dependences `poetry install`
 2) Run `gameboy.py`
 3) Keybinds:
    * Open Games
        * 1 -> Snake
        * 2 -> Pong
        * 3-> MineSweeper
    * Escape -> Exit
